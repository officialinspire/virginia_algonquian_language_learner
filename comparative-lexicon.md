2. **Vowel Correspondences**: There appears to be a systematic relationship between Virginia Algonquian 'a' and Lenape 'i' in certain environments.

3. **Final Consonants**: Word-final consonants in Virginia Algonquian often correspond to similar sounds in Mohegan-Pequot.

4. **Possessive Prefixes**: Many body parts and kinship terms show evidence of possessive prefixing across the language family.

## Notes on Language Relationships

Virginia Algonquian shows closest affinity to the Southern New England Algonquian languages (particularly Mohegan-Pequot) but also shares significant features with the Lenape (Delaware) languages. Some terms show unexpected similarities with more distant Abenaki, suggesting either ancient retentions or possible trade contacts.

The patterns observed in this comparative lexicon support Frank Siebert's analysis that Virginia Algonquian represents a distinct branch within Eastern Algonquian, having split from other languages in the family at an early date but maintaining ongoing contact with them through trade and cultural exchange.

*Note: This comparative lexicon represents a sample of relationships between Virginia Algonquian and related languages. Due to the limited documentary evidence for Virginia Algonquian and varying levels of documentation for other historical Algonquian languages, some entries show gaps where comparable forms are not attested in the historical record.*
